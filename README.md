# review-comments-action

![action example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pshergie/pull-request-auto-reviewer/main/img/example.jpg)

## Usage

This GitHub action post comments based on pull request changes.

## Setup

Since posting comments on GitHub requires write permission you need two create 2 yaml configurations. One to collect PR changes and upload as artifacts and one to download them and apply the script (executes from the main branch).

In the second config file you need to specify 2 params:

- `token`: your GitHub token
- `data-path`: a path to a yaml file with a config that contains `prependMsg` and `checks` props. `prependMsg` is a message that prepends to every message of the bot. Keep empty if not needed. **By default** it's `üóØÔ∏è [pull-request-auto-reviewer]:` (as per screenshot). `checks` props consists of pairs of `paths` and `message` keys. `paths` dedicated to specify path(s) of changes that would trigger posting of followed `message` as a pull request comment. In case of multiple `paths` they should be separated by a comma. `message` could be a simple string or a markdown. An example of such a file:

```- prependMsg: ""
- checks:
    - paths: "**/*.*"
      message: |
        ### Please tick the following checkboxes:

        - [ ] the code is tested
        - [ ] files are compressed
        - [ ] files contain no errors```

There's also an optional `artifact-path`  parameter if you want a different path to artifacts (make sure that you have updated the upload artifacts config as well). The default value is `pr_diff/`

Known problems:

- If a main/master branch was updated, the action won't be working correctly until you rebase the branch where the action is triggered
